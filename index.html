				<p>Im a 15 year old 10th grader and my intrests are surfing, the ocean, clothing, screenprinting, musical compisition, production and sampling. I have been going to the Ross School for six years and the Innovation Lab for two years. My favorite subject is cultural history because I love to see how thing connect and influence each other like past inventions or thoughts affecting the now.</p>

		<p>This year in Ilab I wish to learn new skills and create at least 3 projects. I want to make a carver boards. The hardest part would be making the deck because of the layering, pressing of the wood, and shaping but the wheels and trucks will be easier because I have to just screw them in. I wish to do this because I like to surf and when I am not able to I want to practice and carver boards are a special type of skateboard which imitates the turning and movement of a surfboard. I also want to learn how to screenprint clothes because I have many clothing ideas and just knowing how to screenprint is a very intresting skill. Another reason why I want to learn how to screenprint is because I want to start my own clothing line and company.</p>
