      <h4>Costa Rica</h4>
      <p> For m-term this year I went to the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica. The Osa Peninsula is the most biologically intense places on earth. It hold ups to 2.5% of the earths biodiversity while only taking up 0.001% of the earths surface area. It also has many endemic species. The Osa Peninsula is smaller than Rhode Island yet has more biodiversity than the whole United States and Canada combined. I had a great time on m-term. My favorite things we did, was watch turtles hatch and then release them into the ocean; as well as go surfing in the beautiful beaches of Coast Rica and donated/planted trees to an elementary school. One of the hardest things we did while we were there was do a 9 hour hike through the jungle and beach. It was a tiring yet fulfilling and fun experience. If I had the chance I would do it again since I got to see many species which I had never seen before and look at the mesmerizing ocean.</p>
